This project aims to develop a system for vehicle owner identification of embossed number plate vehicles using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) and K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm. The system will extract the characters from the images of the number plates using OCR and then match them with the characters in the database using the KNN algorithm. The proposed system will provide a fast, accurate and automated way of identifying the owner of a vehicle. The results of the project will be helpful in case of any theft or misuse of the number plate and helps in identifying vehicle owners in an accident situation. Keywords: Optical Character Recognition, KNN, Identification
